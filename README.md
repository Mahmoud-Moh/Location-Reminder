# Location Reminder App
You can use this app, if you want to do something at somewhere, but you have amnesia :) 
When you pass by a place that you want to do something there when you visit again, just open the app and add a reminder and when you pass by this place again, the app will raise a notification with your reminder.
Or even you don't have to pass by the place to make a reminder, you can press on some place on the map and make a reminder at this place.

## The app uses
1-Google maps to know your location.
2-Geofence services to add a geofence around the selected location.
3-Room Database to store reminders locally.
